###**👩‍💻 About Me**

I am a **Software Engineer** with a growing focus on **game development and creative technology**, with a heart for tech that heals, inspires, and empowers.

💡 I started with software engineering because I wanted to blend logic and creativity to make tools and experiences that help people reflect, grow, and feel understood — especially in the mental health space.

🎮 I'm passionate about game development, psychology, and storytelling. Inspired by games like Life is Strange and Celeste, I aim to create interactive narratives and tools that feel emotionally safe and deeply human.

**🚀 I love crafting:**

Therapeutic games (2D & 3D)

Interactive, reflective web apps

Beautiful and mindful UIs

**Soon:** powerful backend services that bring it all to life

**🌟 What Drives Me**

I believe that:

Tech should feel like a soft place to land 🧠💛

Creativity is power when it’s paired with empathy

Learning is endless — and I want to bring others with me

Every line of code can become a lighthouse for someone in a storm 🌊

📚 I get lost in books, in feelings, and in the hope of becoming better than yesterday.
🌊 I feel most connected to myself when I'm staring at the ocean, especially when tired.
**✨ Fun Fact:** I’m an introverted-extrovert who thrives on warmth, small joys, and deep human connections.

**🛠️ Tech & Tools I’m Exploring**
**💻 Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, VB.NET #beginner, Java #beginner

**🧠 Concepts:** OOP, DOM Manipulation, Game Logic, UX Psychology, Functional Programming

**🎮 Game Dev Stack:** Unity (2D + 3D), C#, Visual Scripting, Cinemachine

**🌐 Starting Soon:** Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

**🧪 Currently Learning:** React, APIs, Testing with Jest

**🛠️ Tools:** Git & GitHub, VS Code, Figma, Canva, Google Sheets

**📌 Current Projects**
I’m currently experimenting with:

🧠 Game mechanics & storytelling concepts for therapeutic narrative games

🧩 Daily reflection apps with points and progress tracking

🔌 Backend structures for journaling and growth tools

💬 Some of these ideas are still being shaped — I may reveal more soon!
